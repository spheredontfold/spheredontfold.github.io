# LogR IP Logger

A simple IP logger I wrote in a night that uses a bit of JQuery to make a request to an endpoint of https://ipinfo.io on the clients behalf, therfore getting thier IP. It then takes that response and crafts it into a discord webhook. In the end you get a discord webhook sent to your link giving you some information on the victim. 

### It disguises itself as an innocent *"404 Not Found"* page; here is a picture of what it looks like:

*I do not condone any milicious use of this software, it was made for the purpose of playing pranks on you online friends or just playing around with it yourself.*
